Loaded Potato:

Ingredients
for 1 serving

1 russet potato, washed and scrubbed
1 tablespoon oil
salt, to taste

Preparation
Poke holes in the potato with a fork, then rub with oil and salt.
Place the bacon slices on the same plate as the potato, microwave for 7-9 minutes until the bacon is crispy and the potato is tender. Make sure the bacon does not burn.
Crumble the bacon after it’s cooled down.
Slice the potato in half, then use a fork to fluff up the insides.

Top with sour cream, the crushed bacon bits, and the chives.
